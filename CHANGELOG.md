### A note to release managers

When creating a new release in GitHub, please copy the `[Unreleased]` section to a new versioned
section and use it for the release's notes, in addition to verifying that version numbers are
updated throughout the repository.

## [Unreleased]

## v0.3.0

### Added

- `verso` now supports extracting nested fragments.

## v0.2.0

### Added

- A new weave pattern, `@* <regex>`, can be used which expands to all of the fragments whose IDs
  match the given regular expression.
- Users can now set their own symbols for fragment boundaries, insertion, and so on using
  environment variables. 

### Changed

- Various discrepancies in terminology between the README and source code have been cleaned up.
- Both `verso` and `recto` now print a more helpful error message if argument parsing fails.

## v0.1.2

### Added

- Two new reference operators are now available in `recto`: `relpath` and
  `abspath`. `relpath` inserts the relative path from the current file to the
  fragment's source file while `abspath` inserts the absolute path of the
  fragment file, considering the directory in which `verso` was run as the
  root. (For example, if `verso` is run in directory `/a` and `/a/b.py` contains
  a fragment, then that fragment's `abspath` is `/b.py`.)

## v0.1.1

### Fixed

- Repaired bugs in logic that would reject valid IDs and consolidated the code.

## v0.1.0

### Added
- Initial release of `verso|recto`
- Most of the basic features work: creating annotated fragments, weaving them
  into documents, references, etc.
